With careful consideration and few feed backs, I have decided not to hard mount the I/O port on PCB. It will be 5 pin unpopulated header you can choose to connect appropriate connector or hard wire it to your Radio. My best suited option for ports is M12 data connector, GX12 aviation connector or RJ45 port.<br/>
In addition, I have left the power system alone will be totally users’ discretion. You can use “MH-CD-42” Charging and 5VDC booster module. <br/>
User can use “J1” jumper setting to select PTT_M to contact Ground when PTT is triggered or have PTT_S if the radio PTT is triggered using internal pins.<br/>
You can choose any of the code if you would like to potentiometer then use "BlueDmod-1.1_rev1.2_POT".<br/>
if you do not want to use potentiometer then use "BlueDmod-1.1_rev1.2_non_POT" a default delay of 1000ms is implimented.<br/>
Will keep everyone updated on further developments.<br/>
